In this mini project we capture live webcam video, convert the feed to grayscale, and resize it to fit 1/4th of your screen.

## How It Works
- Captures frames from your default webcam.
- Converts each frame to grayscale.
- Resizes the frame to 1/4 of your screen resolution.
- Displays the result in a window until you press ESC.
